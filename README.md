## Usage and Examples


To engage the users, we wanted them to be able to select from a group of indicators that we believe will give the user the most informative decision tools.

<details>
<summary>Indicators</summary>
RSI: a momentum indicator used to measure the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold conditions in the price of stock or other asset. RSI values of 70 or over indicate that security is becoming overbought or overvalued and may be primed for a trend reversal. RSI value of 30 or below indicates an oversold or undervalued condition. 
 
Moving Avg (200 days): Moving average is a calculation used to analyze data points by creating a series of averages of different subsets of the full data set.  MA smooths out the price data by creating a constantly updated average price. Calculated to identify the trend direction of a stock or to determine its support and resistance levels. 
 
Trading Volume: Measures the number of shares traded in a stock. Looking at volume patterns over time can help get a sense of strength behind advances and declines in specific stocks and entire markets.
